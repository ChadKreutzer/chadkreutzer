I've been interested in programming ever since I first played with a Commodore 64 in third grade. I knew there was a way to get the computer to do what you wanted to do and it didn't take me long to learn just enough BASIC to enable me to fill every screen at the Department Store computer display with whatever I wanted it to say. Over the years, I dabbled in C++, HTML (the internet was brand spanking new,) Java, and Visual Basic programming and development have alwasy been in my blood. Now I [make apps and websites](#portfolio) with languages like JavaScript and Ruby, tools like Bootstrap and jQuery, and frameworks like Sinatra. [Contact me](#contact) and we'll work together to make a website you'll be proud of.
